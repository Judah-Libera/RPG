Doesn't run with standard compiling. works on Visual Studio with all c/c++ stuff installed.
easiest to create c++ VS project and copy paste files/code over. Also seen success with clean then build solution.
chardata.bin seems to not copy over properly. If getting file i/o errors try deleting chardata.bin, program will create a non-corrupted version.
