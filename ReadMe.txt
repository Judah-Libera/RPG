Doesn't run with standard compiling. works on Visual Studio with all c/c++ stuff installed.
easiest to create c++ VS project and copy paste files/code over. Also seen success with clean then build solution.

if save file gets corrupted delete the .bin file in RPG/RPG.
see "how to use.txt" file in RPG/RPG/game backups for instructions on switching save files.

RPG Vx.x.x.zip has a compressed version of the debug folder to use when creatign a project to run this.
